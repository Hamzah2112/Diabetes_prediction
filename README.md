# Diabetes_prediction

The dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. **The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically classify whether or not a patient has diabetes**, based on certain diagnostic measurements (the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, etc) included in the dataset. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
